<h1>Welcome to my Exam</h1>
<p>
  These are the core features of Angular using bootstrap with a responsive
  design
</p>
<pre>
Requirements 1
● routing between 2 pages (create a new routable page)
● basic form management using one of angular forms (validation, submit, clear, etc...)
● pass/share data from page 1 to page 2 (show data in page 2), use some pipable operators.

Requirements 2:
● Refer to the attached web design .
● png version of the logo has been provided.
● Other Images can be replaced. Candidate can
  either cut the images from the pdf,
  or replace them with free google images of
  their choice, as long as the sizes are in
  correct ratio based from the design.
● Forms should have validation.
● Webpage should be responsive.
  There’s no mobile page design.
  Adjust the page to make it readable
  in ipad/mobile version.
● Stylesheet compiled from a LESS file is a plus.

Comments:
The iterviewer didn't provide the assets/sample design that's why I created my own version in CRUD operation.
I combined the two requirements in one application to make it more advanced.
I decided to used template driven forms instead of reactive forms for much faster development.
I used SCSS preprocess much better than LESS.
In addition to the task, I included rest-api integration using json placeholder with lorem ipsum data

THANK YOU

Take Note: This is just one of my simple folder structure and routing setup without lazy load.

<button class="btn btn-secondary me-3" [routerLink]="['/user']">
  Page not found section
</button>
<button class="btn btn-dark me-3" [routerLink]="['/posts']">Posts Section</button>
